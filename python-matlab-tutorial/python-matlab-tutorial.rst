About MATLAB and Python
========================

MATLAB
-------

`From Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB>`_:  MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) is a high level computer language/interactive software package developed and distributed by MathWorks. MATLAB was first developed in the 1970s by Cleve Molar. Cleve was later joined by John N. Little and Steve Bangert and the three went on to found MathWorks. MATLAB excels at performing matrix operations and can handle large data sets (stored as matrices) very easily. MATLAB was originally designed as a user friendly interface for `LINPACK <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK>`_ and `EISPACK <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EISPACK>`_ and so was intended for linear algebra application. Since then MATLAB has greatly expanded it's core abilities to encompass a large array of graphic and numeric applications. These core abilities are expanded through the addition of specialized "tool boxes".

Python
-------

`From Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>`_: Python is a high-level programming language whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability. Python aims to combine "remarkable power with very clear syntax", and its standard library of built-in functions is large and comprehensive.  

We will use the [http://numpy.scipy.org/ NumPy and SciPy] modules (the equivalent of a MATLAB toolbox), to provide scientific computing capabilities to Python.  These modules, like MATLAB, allow you to handle large data arrays with little effort.  

We will also use the [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/index.html matplotlib] module, which provides Python with plotting capabilities similar to MATLAB.

You might not be familiar with Python.  Here is a comparison with MATLAB:

* Many companies already use it as a standard package now.
* It can run on Windows, Linux and Mac computers
* Commercial software support is available from 3rd parties.
* The software can be installed on a local desktop, or in a networked environment and run remotely.
* It is free (both for academic and commercial use), so it can readily be deployed and used anywhere.
* Installation is straightforward.
* The license is not restrictive: you can legally modify and improve the software.
* There are excellent add-on libraries for almost anything you need.
* It promotes good practice of writing a code file, and then running it (like MATLAB and R).  The code documents what you have done, and you can always repeat your analysis on a new data set, or share the code with colleagues.  Other software packages tend to promote a more point-and-click approach, so you can't always retrace your steps.
* There are multicore and 64-bit versions of Python available to process large data sets, and do parallel data processing.


Installing MATLAB or Python
=============================

MATLAB
------

MATLAB may be purchased from `The Mathworks <http://mathworks.com>`_ either as the commercial version or student version.  You will also require the Statistics Toolbox for this tutorial.

Python
------

Python is freely available. The latest stable version that we recommend for this tutorial is version 2.6, because it is compatible with the external libraries that we will use.

Windows users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python is an open source software. Because of this, various groups have "packaged" the official Python distribution to meet certain needs. For example:

* The official (reference) Python distribution: http://python.org
* Enthought Python distribution: http://www.enthought.com/epd 
* IronPython: http://ironpython.net/
* JPython: http://www.jython.org/

For this course we recommend you use the version distributed from http://www.pythonxy.com/, and called Python(X,Y).   If you are an experienced programmer, comfortable with the command prompt, then we actually recommend you use `Enthought's Python distribution <http://www.enthought.com/epd>`_: see the :ref:`Mac/Linux instructions <matpy-mac-linux-install>` below.

**Python(X,Y) installation**

* Official website: http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/
* Latest version (January 2011): 2.6.5.6
* Official download page: http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads

#.	Run the software installation after downloading the installation file from the above link, run the program.

#.	The default installation options are perfect for this tutorial.

#.	It can take quite a while to install.

#.	Continue with the :ref:`rest of this tutorial <matpy-getting-started>` to learn how to use Python.

Mac and Linux users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python is already installed on all Mac computers and most (all?) Linux computers. If you go to your command prompt (the program is called "Terminal" on Macs), you can type ``python`` and it will start a bare-bones Python session.

However, we highly recommend you use the Enthought Python distribution, which is better suited to our course. It contains all the tools that we require. Please follow these instructions to install it.

#.	Visit the academic download section of Enthought's website if you are a student, or download the 30-day trial, or purchase a regular license.

#.	Download and install the software.
#.	It will take some time, because it installs Python and a large collection of libraries (modules).
